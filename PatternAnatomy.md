  * Header (supplies, meta-information, generic instruction definitions)
  * Directions (the procedure to knit the desired object)

# Components #
  * Operation - everything within the directions (and instruction definitions in the header)
    * Block Operations: procedures that occur outside of a row (Use Needles, Declare Round Knitting)
    * Inline Operations: procedures that occur inside of a row (Knit 5)
    * Composite Operations: procedures which contain one or more operations (Repeat [k3, p3] to end)
    * Can be aggregated into Instruction groups
  * Row
    * A block operation and a composite operation
    * Contains the real "meat" of the directions
    * Operations contained with a row are, by definition, inline operations
  * Instruction
    * A formal grouping of rows
    * Can be repeated in a variety of ways
      * x number of times
      * for a particular length (including a knitter's desired length)
      * until a certain number of stitches remain on the needles
      * until an arbitrary test condition holds true
    * Have the potential to be charted
  * Instruction Group  <-- more accurately "operation groups"?
    * An optional way to group logically similar operations
    * Has a title
    * May indicate a distinct component of the object to knit
    * Examples include "Turn Heel", "Make Sleeve", "Work Body"
  * Section
    * A way to group a sequence of operations into a logical paragraph
    * Different from an instruction group because there is no title
    * Can be interpreted as an actual paragraph by rendering software
